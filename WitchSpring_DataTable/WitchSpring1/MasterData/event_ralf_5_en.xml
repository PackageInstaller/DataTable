none-4:Haha…the response I received from the Pope last time with the Dark Magic Stone was precious.

heroin_sigh:I'm guessing he wants something more powerful?

none-4:Quite. The Lavastein Stone.

none-4:The Lavastein Golem was created by the Humans, by purifying and compressing countless Dark Magic Stones.

none-4:Of course, it was uncontrollable and discarded in the Golem Cave.

none-4:It is a step up from the Lava Stone you fetched for me last time.

heroin_normal:That's what the Pope wants?

none-4:The Lavastein Stone contains much more powerful magic power than the Dark Magic Stones, but is less dominating.

none-4:Thus, it is preferable to the Dark Magic Stones…

none-4:But it is too rare that the Papacy had given up on acquiring it.

heroin_sigh:This is going to get ugly, too…

none-4:The Pope is insane. All that he orders are dangerous commodities…just delivering them is too much for me to handle.

heroin_normal:Fine. I'll get it for you!
