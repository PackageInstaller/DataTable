0^justice:…I love you.

0^heroin:Hehe…what was that? Better say it to me again!

0^justice:I…umm…

0^justice:I. LOVE. YOU!

0^heroin:Hehe! Yes, that's how you should say it!

0^heroin:I love you, too!

0^heroin:And…

0^heroin:Thank you.

0^justice:Hmm? For what?

0^heroin:When I was a Witch, it was really rough for me. Because of the Warriors!

0^justice:Oh…I apologized about that many times…

0^heroin:No, no, no! It's not about that!

0^justice:…?

0^heroin:When you saved me at the cliff…

0^heroin:That was when I first felt hope.

0^justice:What kind of hope…?

0^heroin:Hope of not being hated.

0^justice:…Not being hated?

0^heroin:You used to harass me the worst! But then I saw your attitude towards me change…

0^heroin:And I began to hope that maybe I could be loved by someone.

0^heroin:Since then, I thought of you often. You reminded me of hope…

0^heroin:And so my heart was always fluttering, and I never felt alone, even though you weren't always there.

0^heroin:It used to get really gloomy, with only Black Joe around! Hehe.

0^justice:Haha, I bet!

0^justice:And I also bet that you never dreamed your hope would come true, right?

0^justice:…Like this.

0^noname:(*kiss*)
