nWarrior:He finally stopped…

heroin_normal:Ha, that was simple!

nWarrior:Wi…Witch?

heroin_normal:Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

nWarrior:…You would truly let us go?

heroin_normal:Don't YOU attack me, okay?

nWarrior:As you can see, we have no strength to fight…we were hopelessly outmatched…

heroin_normal:So why did a Dark Warrior come near the village?

nWarrior:He was once our comrade.

heroin_surprised:…??

nWarrior:We found a Dark Magic Stone in Lalaque Forest and was on our way to deliver it to the Pope.

nWarrior:He tried to steal the Dark Magic Stone. The stone is sold for lots of gold in the underworld.

heroin_normal:And what happened to him?

nWarrior:He…probably didn't expect to be devoured by the stone so quickly.

nWarrior:He began screaming with his hand in the storage box. I think he was devoured as soon as he touched the stone.

heroin_normal:Weird…nothing happens to me when I touch the stone!

nWarrior:That's because you're a Witch…we're Humans.

heroin_normal:I think the greater your desire for the stone, the quicker you're dominated by its power.

heroin_normal:Maybe that was why he was devoured instantly?

nWarrior:He did have high ambitions for rising in status…but…

nWarrior:If you're not affected by it, then does that mean you have no desire for power…?

heroin_normal:Why would I need power, if you don't try to capture me?

heroin_sigh:I have to go about and gather magic ingredients, then train everyday…all because of you!

nWarrior:Oh…I see…

nWarrior:I have a request…I don't know when he's going to wake up again, so please take the Dark Magic Stone away from him…

heroin_normal:That won't be a problem!
