heroin_smile:Hello, Lord Durok!

durok:Lucia? What brings you to the temple?

heroin_smile:I just came to say hello!

heroin_smile:I wondered how you were doing these days. Last time, I didn't get to say hello properly!

durok:I was a bit busy helping Aramute.

durok:I am not so busy now.

heroin_smile:Aha…All the Temple Lords seem really busy!

heroin_sigh:My mom included, that is.

durok:There are many prayers regarding the dead.

durok:But not all Temple Lords are busy.

heroin_normal:…?

durok:Aimhard is not busy.

durok:Ever since he erected barriers in dangerous regions eons ago, he has nothing to do.

heroin_oing:Haha…

durok:Yet, to maintain the barriers, Aimhard must constantly provide them with magic power…

durok:And so, he may have time to spare…but we cannot use him for other work.

durok:We cannot have his barriers fall due to insufficient magic power.

heroin_smile:So, Lord Aimhard has an important job!

heroin_smile:He always seemed so relaxed, so I figured he had nothing to do.

durok:He does have nothing to do.

durok:Curse him.

heroin_smile:Hehe…
