heroin_smile:I see a small island over there. For some reason, I want to go there!

blackBird_normal:That island is teeming with monsters. We'd best not go there, Master.

heroin_smile:Is that so? Then I bet there are awesome magic ingredients there!

blackBird_normal:I can't go there. Give it up.

heroin_normal:But you're flying.

blackBird_normal:…!

heroin_smile:Take me there. You have to obey your master, right?

blackBird_normal:……

heroin_normal:Well? Do you want me to roast you alive?

blackBird_normal:Very well, Master.

heroin_normal:If you drop me into the water, you're dead.

blackBird_normal:Oh, why would I?
