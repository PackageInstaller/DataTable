aramute:One day, you shall oversee a spring, as your mother Elysion does.

aramute:But you will not be as busy as I.

aramute:Elysion handles the prayers regarding life.

aramute:As we learn the value of life by the grace of deathâ€¦

aramute:Many of these prayers are not granted, as one should not revive every being.

aramute:And so, many of the prayers brought to Elysion are not answered.
