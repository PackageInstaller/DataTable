heroin_crisis:Ughh!!

heroin_sigh:Whew…I think the robe's magic protected us.

kate:Why…how…?

kate:How is your soul still intact…?

heroin_angry:What's that supposed to mean?

kate:Give me your rage…your pain…your wounds…

kate:Come into us…with your venomous loneliness…

kate:All will be peaceful…when you join us……

blackBird_normal:…Us?

blackBird_normal:She must be…

blackBird_normal:A colony of souls.

heroin_normal:Souls?

blackBird_normal:The Dark Magic Stones are said to lure in souls as well.

blackBird_normal:I think wandering souls have become attached to the Dark Magic Stone in this cave.

blackBird_normal:And now, it's luring the Humans inside.

blackBird_normal:Just like it lured us.

kate:Strange…

kate:You definitely have rage and hatred…

kate:So why…why won't you come to us…?

heroin_angry:So what?

heroin_angry:You're annoying!!

event:5

heroin_crisis:Eeek!!

blackBird_normal:Master!

heroin_crisis:I was injured as soon as I cast my magic…!

heroin_crisis:Black Joe! What was that??

blackBird_normal:Reflect magic…

blackBird_normal:It reflects magic, dealing roughly equal damage taken back to the caster.

blackBird_normal:Since it's reflecting your own magic…

blackBird_normal:Lady Elysion's robe may not protect you!

blackBird_normal:Magic attacks will be risky. If you have to use them, be careful!

heroin_crisis:Will physical attacks work?

blackBird_normal:Not exactly on her…

blackBird_normal:Imagine breaking the Dark Magic Stone inside her, instead!

heroin_angry:Got it! Let's do this!!
