eliy:Oh, Lucia.

heroin_smile:Mom!

heroin_smile:When are you done working?

eliy:I have some work piled up. Oh, I really want to finish it and be with my daughter…!

heroin_sigh:I'd love to help…but I don't know much about your work…

eliy:It's just that I have some long-overdue things for a while.

eliy:You can wait, yes?

heroin_smile:Sure!

blackBird_normal:Master. Are you bored?

eliy:Do I look bored?

blackBird_normal:Oh…I was talking to Lady Lucia. Haha.

heroin_normal:Why?

blackBird_normal:Master. How about sending Master to the Mirror Room?

heroin_normal:The Mirror Room? What's that?

eliy:Ack. Try to differentiate between us. You're confusing me.

blackBird_normal:Oh…I've become so used to it…

blackBird_normal:Lady Elysion? How about sending Lady Lucia to the Mirror Room?

eliy:The Mirror Room is where one faces herself in battle.

eliy:It's also one of the trainings Deity descendants must go through to manage the springs…!

heroin_surprised:Oh…I didn't know that!

eliy:I think you're old enough for it, my daughter.

blackBird_normal:Heh. I thought the time was right.

eliy:I've unlocked the gate. Go through the warp gate to the right.

heroin_smile:Okay, mom!
