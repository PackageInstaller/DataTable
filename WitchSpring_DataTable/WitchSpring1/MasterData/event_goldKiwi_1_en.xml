heroin_smile:Wow! It's SOOOO cute!!

blackBird_normal:A Goldkiwi Chick.

heroin_surprised:I…I want to catch it!

blackBird_normal:You can't use Mind Control magic. It's too weak, and will die from the magic.

heroin_sigh:Can't we just take it, then?

blackBird_normal:It may get scared and slowly wither away.

heroin_sigh:Then what should I do…?

blackBird_normal:It looks like it lost its mother.

blackBird_normal:Maybe it will follow you once you help it out?

heroin_sad:Oh…that's so sad…

heroin_smile:Then I guess I have to raise it!

blackBird_normal:…Are you sad, or glad…?
heroin_smile:Anyway, it looks thirsty!

blackBird_normal:A Goldkiwi Chick only drinks morning dew. It won't drink any water.

heroin_normal:Really? Got it!
