heroin_normal:Ah…what's that…? Looks dark and ugly.

blackBird_normal:A Dark Warrior.

heroin_surprised:Warrior…?

blackBird_normal:But not like normal Warriors. It's a mindless Human who has been devoured by the Dark Magic Stone.

heroin_normal:A Dark Magic Stone…what's that?

blackBird_normal:A stone imbued with powerful dark magic.

blackBird_normal:It dominates anyone who touches it.

heroin_normal:What happens when you're devoured by the stone?

blackBird_normal:You lose reason and emotions, and rush towards anything that you can attack.

blackBird_normal:There's been a rumor of a Human who absorbed a Dark Magic Stone completely, but no one knows who it is.

blackBird_normal:Many Humans who think themselves to be powerful have challenged the stone, and they all ended up like this.

blackBird_normal:The more desire one has for power, the easier it is to be devoured.

heroin_normal:So why would they attempt this, if they know?

blackBird_normal:They all believe that they could control the stone with their iron will.

blackBird_normal:Humans blindly worship the principles of power…

blackBird_normal:But the more powerful you become, the easier it is to be devoured.

heroin_normal:They're so stupid…do they really want power, even with those risks?

blackBird_normal:Aren't you the same, Master? You travel each day, collecting dangerous magic ingredients. And you train…

heroin_sigh:I do that for survival…I wouldn't need to, if there were no Warriors.

heroin_normal:So, what do they yield when you defeat them? I bet they give powerful magic ingredients, since they're strong!

blackBird_normal:They give you Dark Magic Stones. But you can't face them yet.

heroin_angry:You think I'm weak?!

blackBird_normal:You barely handle the normal Warriors…they're far more powerful than Palace Warriors.

heroin_surprised:Oh…so strong, I see.

heroin_sigh:Then I'll just wait until he's gone…
