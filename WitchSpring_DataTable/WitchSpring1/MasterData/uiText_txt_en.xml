100`MAG affects the damage of offense magic. 
101`MP is consumed with each magic use. It may also be required for training.
102`HP represents the Witch's action capacity. Insufficient HP can restrict training or battles.
103`STR represents basic attack power other than magic use.
104`DEF represents damage reduction in battle. High DEF reduces damage to be taken when attacked.
105`AGI refers to the Witch's action speed. High AGI grants quicker attack turns during battles. It also affects success chance of magical/physical attacks.
106`LUK affects the chance of hunting success and certain event encounters.
107`When FTG is closer to 0, the base battle stats increase up to 20%. Conversely, high FTG lowers additional stat bonuses and success chance of certain events. FTG accumulates when you are continuously active without sleeping, and will decrease when you sleep.
108`REP is the reputation the Witch has among Humans. REP increases the more the Witch cares for Humans, and may affect her fate after 100 days.
