0^heroin:I faced the Pope…but then lost and now it's come to this…

0^blackBird_normal:Don't blame yourself, Master. You did your best!

0^blackBird_normal:And maybe we can restore Lady Elysion's spring! If we can gather magic ingredients with great magic power…

0^heroin:The Witch Hunt has been reinforced since then…so it's difficult to gather any magic ingredients…

0^blackBird_normal:I know it's hard, but…let's try again together!

0^blackBird_normal:Master! You can do it!!

0^heroin:…

0^heroin:I'm just glad I at least have you…you mean a lot to me.
