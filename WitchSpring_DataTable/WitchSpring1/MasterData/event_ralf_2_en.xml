none-4:I require the teeth of a Black Lion this time.

heroin_normal:Teeth? What for?

none-4:The Black Lion's teeth are very hard, and useful for sharpening blades.

heroin_sigh:Oh…then that's a no-no for me… If the Warriors get better blades…

none-4:The choice is yours. Still, you can earn gold to acquire better gear from me, no?

heroin_sigh:Which all benefit you, in the end…

none-4:All is well that ends well.
