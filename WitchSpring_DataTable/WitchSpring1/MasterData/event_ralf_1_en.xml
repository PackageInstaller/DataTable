heroin_smile:Is there anything you want this time?

none-4:Hmm…this request is quite dangerous.

heroin_smile:You're worried for me? You don't have to be!

none-4:Not you, but I. It is a magic ingredient that has recently been outlawed…

heroin_normal:Oh, okay…so are you gonna ask me or not?

none-4:Well, I suppose.

none-4:Get me Lava's stone. It's part of the body of Lava, a Golem created by the Humans in the past to wage war with the gods…

none-4:The magic engraved on the stone is powerful and dangerous, so it is circulated in the market after being purified by the Papacy.

heroin_normal:Huh…? So why is it dangerous, if it's already being traded?

none-4:The problem lies with the fact that there are those who desire the unpurified rough stones. I do not know who they are…

heroin_smile:Whatever. So, how much will you pay this time?

none-4:4,000 gold.

heroin_surprised:Wow! Why so generous all of a sudden?

none-4:Because it is worth that much.

heroin_normal:…Oww, I could have been paid more, if I was able to freely visit the Human villages…!

heroin_smile:Okay, then…! I'll go look for it!
