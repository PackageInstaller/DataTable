blackBird_normal:Ma…Master?

blackBird_normal:Master!! Are you alright?!

heroin_angry:No, and it's your fault!! You attacked me when your seal was broken!

blackBird_normal:My seal broke again when you fainted at Durok Temple.

blackBird_normal:I was attacking Justice, when the Palace Warriors rushed in…

blackBird_normal:And now I've also been captured.

heroin_normal:They must have put you in here because they couldn't find a room to lock you up…

heroin_sigh:So why did you lose your mind?

blackBird_normal:I went berserk after waking up. So I think they cast some sort of suppression magic on me.

blackBird_normal:So I couldn't recognize you, Master…forgive me!

heroin_sigh:Well, you weren't yourself, so…I'll let it go, this time.

blackBird_normal:It hurt! My feathers are scorched black!

heroin_normal:You were always black.

blackBird_normal:I managed to dodge a bit, as I knew your move patterns…or else I would have been killed.

heroin_normal:…That's curious.

heroin_smile:How did you remember my move patterns, when you were not yourself?

blackBird_normal:……Umm…

heroin_smile:So it wasn't all a simple mistake when you attacked me?

blackBird_normal:…Ehhhhhrm…

heroin_smile:I felt something when you hit me…like…resentment?

blackBird_normal:Nyahaha…that's…silly…

heroin_normal:I'm going to let it slide for now, since we need to escape. But I'll make sure to roast you alive later!!

blackBird_normal:…*whimper*
