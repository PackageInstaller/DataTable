lion:I was born here.

heroin_sigh:Oh…you finally meet them in ages, and I scared them away…sorry!

heroin_normal:But if you were born here…how did you become a Guardian Beast of Lord Arua, who lives far from here?

lion:This is near Lord Aimhard's temple. My first master was Lord Aimhard. He raised me, then gave me to Lord Arua.
