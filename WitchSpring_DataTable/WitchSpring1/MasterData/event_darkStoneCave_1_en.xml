heroin_normal:Hmm. So this was the source of that ominous energy?

blackBird_normal:I think so. But…I wonder if it was always this powerful…?

heroin_normal:The energy I sensed outside was similar to this one…

heroin_normal:But I don't think it's this one, per se. The entire mine is filled with dark magic power.

blackBird_normal:I think I know now…this place…

heroin_normal:…?

blackBird_normal:It's a source site of the Dark Magic Stones.

heroin_normal:A source site?

blackBird_normal:The cave where Dark Magic Stones were first discovered. But back then, there were only tiny bits of stones…

blackBird_normal:So it merely hinted at the potential of the Dark Magic Stones.

blackBird_normal:It used to be a smaller cave, but since it's been dug extensively…

heroin_normal:The Pope must have ordered more stones to be mined.

heroin_normal:So that thing should be more powerful than the others, right?

blackBird_normal:Yes. But I don't think you'd lose.
