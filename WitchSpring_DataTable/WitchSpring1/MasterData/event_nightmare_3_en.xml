blackBird_normal:Oh…my…

heroin_sigh:Phew…

heroin_normal:Well? Did I just surpass the ancient Deities?

blackBird_normal:At least in battle prowess, yes.

blackBird_normal:Indeed…you have…

heroin_sigh:Is this some sort of a prank? I'm not in the mood for pranks…

blackBird_normal:I think the springs will be closed forever soon.

heroin_crisis:What are you talking about?!

blackBird_normal:Why don't we talk about this at home…

heroin_sigh:??
