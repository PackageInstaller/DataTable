heroin_surprised:Luna…!

runa_normal:P…Pieberry?!

heroin_suprised:You were captured too?!

runa_normal:Yup…but how did you get out?

heroin_normal:It's a long story, but I was lucky!

heroin_normal:I'll get you out after I defeat the Pope!

runa_normal:*sigh* …Be realistic…you should run away!

heroin_sigh:You sound just like Michelle…

runa_normal:Michelle? She's here, too?!

heroin_normal:Yeah. She's held in another cell.

runa_normal:Serves her right! She deserves it for selling me out! Ha!

heroin_normal:She really regrets it…she was so worried about you.

runa_normal:…

runa_normal:Hmmph…so why did she do something she'd regret, then…?

heroin_normal:Anyway, just hold on for a little longer!

runa_normal:*whine* …I want to get out, too…
