0^heroin_normal:Black Joe! How much magic power do I need to gather to meet mom again?

0^blackBird_normal:I'm not sure…however…

0^blackBird_normal:Since Lady Elysion is merely asleep…I think you will need to gather as much as she used to have when she was awake.

0^blackBird_normal:Hmm…but what prey can provide that much magic ingredients…?

0^blackBird_normal:Do you want to hunt the Lightning Dragon?

0^heroin_smile:Yes! A Dragon's horn should refill some of the magic power!!

0^blackBird_normal:You seem very focused. And you look more positive…

0^heroin_normal:I now have a clear goal. Before, I just struggled to survive, without meaning…

0^blackBird_normal:I'm glad I took you to Lady Elysion.

0^heroin_normal:Hey, I see the Dragon Valley ahead!

0^blackBird_normal:Be careful. The Lightning Dragon is the most powerful of all the Dragons!

0^heroin_smile:Which means it's perfect for refilling mom's mana, right?!

0^heroin_smile:Boss Boar! Charge!!
