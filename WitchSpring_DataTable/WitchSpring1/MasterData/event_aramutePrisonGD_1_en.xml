GD:Greetings, Lady Lucia!

heroin_normal:Oh, you're that guard captain!

GD:Forgive my past insolence. I was merely following orders…

heroin_smile:It's fine.

heroin_normal:So, I can't go down yet?

GD:The collapsed prison has not been repaired, so it is off-limits.

heroin_normal:But there might still be some Dark Warriors down there! Let me take care of them. Stand aside!

GD:I must follow orders…so I cannot.

heroin_smile:Really?

heroin_normal:Lady Lucia commands you! Move!

GD:I must follow Lord Aramute's orders.

heroin_sigh:Ah…fine.
