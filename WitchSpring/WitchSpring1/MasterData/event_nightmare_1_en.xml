heroin_crisis:……

blackBird_normal:…Did you feel that?

heroin_crisis:Yeah…his energy…it's not just simply dark…

heroin_crisis:The energy radiating from his body is so toxic…I can't even guess how powerful it is!

blackBird_normal:Once a hero to Humans, and the greatest Warrior…

blackBird_normal:But now a Dark Warrior.

blackBird_normal:He's also the first Human ever to absorb a Dark Magic Stone.

heroin_crisis:But how could he become so powerful…?

heroin_crisis:I know the stones hold great magic power, but…not this much!

blackBird_normal:That Warrior was the first to perfectly absorb the stone.

blackBird_normal:That's why it became a fad for Warriors to find the stones…

blackBird_normal:Of course, they all failed to absorb the stones - not like him.

heroin_normal:Then why is he like this, now?

blackBird_normal:He should have stopped at his first stone, but he kept searching for more Dark Magic Stones to absorb…

blackBird_normal:And then when the power exceeded his limit, he couldn't control the sudden surge of magic.

blackBird_normal:And so, the most powerful Warrior in history was born…

blackBird_normal:But he was Human no longer.

heroin_normal:Could I beat him?

blackBird_normal:His strength and stamina are probably on par with a Dragon.

blackBird_normal:But since his Dragon-level power is condensed a smaller body…the impact will be intense.

heroin_surprised:…That's why Lord Aimhard personally erected a barrier…

blackBird_normal:Even the Deities couldn't purify him. They only managed to lock him up behind the barrier…

blackBird_normal:Anyway, if you defeat him, then you'll be acknowledged as the greatest! The Warriors won't dare challenge you.
