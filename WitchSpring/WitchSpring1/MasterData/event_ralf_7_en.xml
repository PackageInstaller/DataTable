none-4:Let us test your limit.

heroin_normal:What do you want me to do this time?

none-4:Get me the Horn of the Lightning Dragon.

heroin_surprised:Umm…by the Lightning Dragon…you mean the huge Dragon that shoots out lightning bolts?!

none-4:It is a legendary Dragon that no one has witnessed.

none-4:But if I show the Horn of the Lightning Dragon to the Papacy, they will buy it for a hundred thousand gold or more.

heroin_normal:Then I'll sell it to you for 80,000 gold!

none-4:Ha, I'll give you ten thousand gold.

heroin_angry:Are you joking?! You said you were going to sell it for a hundred thousand!

none-4:Yey I may not be able to. It has no fixed price, after all…

heroin_normal:…I see…

heroin_normal:20,000 gold, then!!

none-4:I do not have that much gold on me.

heroin_sigh:…Umm…then how much can you pay me…?

none-4:Fifteen thousand gold, then. I can give it to you as soon as you get the horn.

heroin_sigh:That sounds fishy, but…fine.

none-4:Hmm, but can you actually get it? The beast has only been witnessed by a few people and is basically a rumor…there is no proof of its existence.

heroin_normal:(I once saw it fly over my house and beyond the Golem Mountain…)

heroin_normal:Don't worry. Have the gold ready when I come back!
