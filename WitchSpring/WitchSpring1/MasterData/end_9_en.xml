4^Pieberry became the Ultimate Witch, after defeating Nightmare.

4^Now she is the most powerful Witch, one who cannot be bothered by the Warriors or the Pope.

4^And so none dare approach the Black Witch Forest these days.

0^heroin_normal:I gathered power to claim the springs, but…

0^heroin_sad:Oh, dear…all the springs have closed down while I was focusing on gaining power…

0^blackBird_normal:…Master, are you alright?

0^heroin_angry:Black Joe! Is there another way?! To meet mom again!!

0^blackBird_normal:If you want to just restore Lady Elysion's spring…

0^blackBird_normal:Perhaps infusing the spring with immense magic power will do the trick.

0^blackBird_normal:Of course, you'll need a magic ingredient with pure magic power, not something like the Dark Magic Stones tainted with evil.

0^blackBird_normal:for example, orbs of the Spirits or the artifacts of Dragons…

0^heroin_normal:Really?! Then that's not a problem! I now have the power to acquire anything, anywhere!

0^blackBird_normal:Well……you see…

0^heroin_normal:What's the matter?

0^blackBird_normal:Actually, you used all those rare magic ingredients on gaining power…so I don't know if we can find more at all…

0^heroin_surprised:Oh……

0^heroin_sad:I used them on me, to save mom and the Temple Lords…

0^blackBird_normal:Don't blame yourself too much…

0^blackBird_normal:I'm sure Lady Elysion is proud of you for becoming so powerful by yourself.

0^heroin_cry:No!! I became powerful to meet mom - so what good is it if I can't see her again?!

0^heroin_cry:Waaaah!!

0^blackBird_normal:Still…let's try to go on a quest, Master.

0^heroin_sad:*sniffle*

0^heroin_sad:…

0^heroin_sad:Okay…I guess there are some places we haven't ventured yet!
