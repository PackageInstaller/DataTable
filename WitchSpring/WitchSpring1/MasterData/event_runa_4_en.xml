heroin_smile:Luna!

runa:Don't shout so loudly! What if a Warrior hears us while passing by?

heroin_sigh:Oww…I was so glad to see you…! And who would even come to this freezing place…?

runa:Oh, right! The Ice Cave is colder on the inside, so remember that.

heroin_smile:Oh…are you worried about me? My robe is really warm, so not to worry!

runa:I'm not worried about you getting cold.

heroin_sigh:Huh…?

runa:Your Flame Magic won't be as hot in there.

runa:I'll give you a book about the basics of my Ice Magic. Your magic power will be more than enough to learn it.

heroin_surprised:Wow…! Thanks!!

heroin_smile:I'll teach you my Flame Magic next time!

runa:It's okay. Flame Magic isn't very useful here. You don't need to come back to do that.

heroin_sigh:But…

runa:Maybe bring some food…

heroin_normal:Food…?

runa:Never mind. You're annoying, so don't ever come back!

heroin_normal:(Oh…this place may be devoid of Warriors, but also food…)

heroin_smile:(Food…maybe I'll bring some that I like…?)
