heroin_sigh:Back-to-back battles…so draining…

blackBird_normal:You should rest, Master.

runa:…

runa_normal:You're really strong! I envy that…

heroin_smile:Hehe, you're embarrassing me…

runa_normal:Anyway, you did save me…so thanks…hmmph…

runa_normal:So what made you come this far?

heroin_normal:I'm looking for Durok Temple. Do you know where it is?

runa_normal:Oh, Lord Durok's temple…!

runa_normal:It lies to the north, but you can't take that path, as it's blocked by ice.

heroin_normal:Black Joe. Let's fly over it!

blackBird_normal:Gaaah.

runa_normal:If you ride on this ugly, small bird, then you'll be swept away by the strong winds!

heroin_smile:Right? He's really ugly.

blackBird_normal:…What are you two talking about…?

runa_normal:There's a hole on the ceiling of the southern ice cave.

runa_normal:The wind doesn't blow inside the cave, so you will be able to fly up from there!

heroin_smile:Okay! We'll tackle it like we did with the Golem Cave!

blackBird_normal:You should lose some weight, Master. You've been growing recently, and becoming heavy.

heroin_smile:…What was that?

blackBird_normal:Nothing…

runa_normal:However, the Ice Cave is wide and filled with nothing but ice, so you'll get lost if you just wander around.

runa_normal:Light from the ceiling will seep through at each waypoint…so follow the light.

heroin_smile:Follow the light? Got it!

runa_normal:Thank you, with everything. I don't know what you want to do in the temple, but I wish you luck.

heroin_smile:We have to help each other. So we're friends now, right?

runa_normal:Maybe not yet…? But I hope you find luck. Bye!
