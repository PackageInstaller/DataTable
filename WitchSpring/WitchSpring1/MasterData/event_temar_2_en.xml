heroin_normal:But I need to shrink you to bring you along as a pet…

heroin_sigh:*sigh* But you're too big to miniaturize with my magic power…!

temar:I refuse to be a pet…

heroin_sigh:Yeah…too much, right?

temar:Instead, I shall give you a mark you can use to summon me in need.

temar:Your magic power shall be sufficient for the summoning.

heroin_smile:Wow…! So I can call you when I need you!!

temar:You will require my help in Aramute Temple.
