lion:It has been awhile, Lighting Bell.

lightingbell:Aslan. Why are you here, instead of guarding your master's spring?

lion:This Deity has restored Lord Arua's spring. And I was commanded by my master to protect her.

heroin_normal:(They know each other. Maybe we won't have to fight!)

lightingbell:Then why have you come to my master's spring?

heroin_normal:I came to become stronger. Lord Arua increased my magic power!

lightingbell:…

lightingbell:Aslan. Why do you serve this Deity?

lightingbell:No matter how hard I look, I see no will in her. She is but a husk.

heroin_smile:Hey, be nice. Your friend Aslan acknowledged me!

lion:My master acknowledged her. I do not need other reasons.

lightingbell:Then I shall guard this path. My master has yet to speak to me on this matter…!

heroin_sigh:*sigh* …Guess we have to fight, after all…

blackBird_normal:The Guardian Beast of this temple is a Light Spirit.

lightingbell:The entrance was surely blocked - how did you come in?

heroin_smile:I touched somewhere, and it opened by itself! I'm the Witch acknowledged by this temple!

heroin_smile:So why don't you step aside?

lightingbell:The sealing magic of the crystal must be drained…I shall drive you out and re-seal it.

heroin_crisis:*gulp* …!
