none-4:Oh, dear! I have forgotten to procure one unit of Magic Slab!

none-4:Ahâ€¦what should I do? The Magic Slab is hard to come by.

heroin_normal:Want me to get it for you? I can get it at the Golem Cave behind my house.

none-4:Ah, yes! I shall pay you well for this. I must fulfill this quota - it's not about the money, but all about my credibility!

heroin_normal:Okay! But I'll need to be paid more than the Pudding job, since Golems are rough and hard to defeat!

none-4:As always, my payment will be more than sufficient. Please get it for me.
