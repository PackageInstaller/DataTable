heroin_smile:Luna!!

runa:Don't shout so loudly!

heroin_smile:I brought you some strawberries, my favorite!

runa_normal:Straw…strawberries?

heroin_smile:There weren't much to eat nearby, so I got them from somewhere far!

runa_normal:I…I had this with my mom…the night before I was kicked out of the village…

blackBird_normal:(She's going to cry…)

runa:…Waaah!!

heroin_sad:Oh……

heroin_sad:I'm sorry for making you sad. I just thought you might be hungry…

runa_normal:It's okay…I really wanted to taste strawberries.

runa_normal:It was nice to remember my mom. It was a bit sad, too…

heroin_sad:So you never saw your mom again after your exile?

runa_normal:How can I, when I can't even get near the village?

runa_normal:But that's okay…! I have to be tough if I want to survive!

heroin_sad:I know…but I really hope you get to see your mom again.

runa_normal:Thank you for saying that.

runa_normal:Here, take this as a gift. I just crafted this Ice Crystal.

heroin_smile:Wow…it's so pretty!

runa_normal:Grab it to gain access to the magic I put in there. It won't melt, so just be careful not to break it!

heroin_smile:Thank you!! But are you sure you want to give this to me? It looks like it took a lot of magic power to make…

runa_normal:Now I know how to make it, so I can do it again after some rest.

runa_normal:Thanks for the strawberries! I'll go to sleep now - I'm tired.

heroin_smile:Okay! Good night, and see you again!

runa_normal:Heh.

heroin_smile:(I think she secretly likes my visits. I should come here often.)
