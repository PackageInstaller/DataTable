heroin_smile:Michelle!

mishel:Oh, Pieberry!

mishel:Wait…no…

mishel:Lady…Lucia?

heroin_sigh:Stop it. Just call me Pieberry.

mishel:But…you're the daughter of Lady Elysion…

heroin_sigh:Look, we're both Deities…

mishel:I'm just a Hybrid…

heroin_sigh:I don't care. So what?

mishel:Really?

mishel:You're really okay with this?

mishel:Pieberry!

heroin_normal:You really know how to adapt quickly…haha.

mishel:Thank you for saving me!

mishel:When the prison collapsed, I thought I was dead for sure!

mishel:But I knew you would save me!

heroin_sigh:I thought you told me to save myself…

mishel:What are you saying I rooted for you!

mishel:I believed in you!

mishel:*giggles*

heroin_sigh:Yeah…sure…thanks.

mishel:Pieberry! Can I come visit you at Lady Elysion's temple?

heroin_normal:Huh? Sure, why not. Bring Luna with you, too.

mishel:No need for Luna. She's too lazy for that.

runa:What?

mishel:So you're really going to travel all the way to Lady Elysion's temple just to meet Pieberry?

mishel:Do you like Pieberry? Do you adore her?!

runa:I, uh…

mishel:See? She can't answer it.

mishel:But I can, with pride.

mishel:I love Pieberry! I love you so much!! You're the best!!! I love you!!!

heroin_oing:……

mishel:My cute, pretty Pieberry! Can I ask you something?

heroin_sigh:Sure. Ask away.

mishel:Does Lady Elysion need a priest? I think she's so busy that she needs a priest, right?

heroin_normal:Umm…my mom is busy these days, but she said she'll be free after this batch of work.

heroin_normal:So I don't think she needs a priest.

mishel:Shoot…

heroin_normal:Huh?

mishel:Oh…it's nothing! But do let me know if there's a vacant priest job!

mishel:I'm a real hard worker, so I'll be very useful?

heroin_sigh:Haha…got it…
