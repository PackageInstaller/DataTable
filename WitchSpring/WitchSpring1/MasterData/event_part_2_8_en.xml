none-4:Blades are most important to Warriors, but high-class armor is in fashion these days. Light and sturdy.

heroin_normal:Hey…you don't mean to ask me to…

none-4:The carapace of Bigcrabs are popular as armor ingredients. They are hard but easy to mold.

none-4:Unfortunately, the Warriors have been hunting all Bigcrabs they see, so they are difficult to find these days. And so the Bigcrab carapace prices have skyrocketed!

heroin_sigh:*sigh* …You want me to gather armor ingredients for Warriors who want to catch me…that's just too harsh.

none-4:What of it? I get the goods, and you get paid with gold. 

none-4:You will not be disappointed by the payment. Fetch me the ingredients should you be up to the task.

none-4:I heard the fishermen say that Bigcrabs still live on the South Island, as there are no boats to that place.

none-4:Of course, the fishermen cannot catch the Bigcrabs, as they are not Warriors…

heroin_normal:South Island, huh…

none-4:I wish you luck.
