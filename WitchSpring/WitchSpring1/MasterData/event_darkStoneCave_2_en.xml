heroin_surprised:Huh? …All of that is the Dark Magic Stone?

blackBird_normal:It's a huge rough stone…but…

blackBird_normal:Strange.

heroin_normal:What is?

blackBird_normal:The Pope is collecting Dark Magic Stones from other routes, while not touching this huge ore.

heroin_normal:I guess…? I think Ralph also mentioned that.

blackBird_normal:Hmm…

blackBird_normal:…Huh!?

heroin_crisis:…!!

heroin_surprised:…!!

blackBird_normal:…Aack!

heroin_crisis:I've never seen such a thing!

blackBird_normal:They can mutate that much……?

blackBird_normal:If that thing was let outside…what horror.

heroin_crisis:I think the entrance was too small for that brute to pass through…

heroin_crisis:What is the Pope up to?!

blackBird_normal:I do think that was the work of the Pope…

blackBird_normal:But there were no signs of people entering or leaving for some time.

blackBird_normal:Perhaps the Pope closed down this mine because he couldn't control the monster…

heroin_normal:And that's why he left this ore alone, and was gathering the stones from other routes!

blackBird_normal:Shall we return?

heroin_normal:Nope.

heroin_normal:If we turn back now, these things might escape one day.

heroin_normal:Let's investigate fully, since we're already here!

heroin_normal:First, we have to destroy that thing!
