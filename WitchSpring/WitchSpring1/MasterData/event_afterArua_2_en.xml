arua:The weather always changes.

arua:Elysion may oversee life…

arua:But the weather greatly affects the maintenance and destruction of life.

arua:For example…a drought or a storm may destroy the lives of countless Humans…

arua:Yet adequate rain and wind can enrich the lives of those Humans.

arua:And so, my performance can lighten the load of Elysion's work.
