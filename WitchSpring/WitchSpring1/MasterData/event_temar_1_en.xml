heroin_oing:…What's that??

blackBird_normal:*gulp* …He's gotten bigger with time…

temar:I have been waiting for you.

heroin_normal:…?

temar:Lord Durok said someone will come to restore all the springs one day.

temar:I can sense the magic powers of Lord Arua, Lord Aimhard and Lady Elysion in you.

heroin_smile:Yup! I've been restoring the springs!

heroin_smile:Things are going smoothly! We might not have to fight this time!

blackBird_normal:We better not. Temar is the most powerful among the Guardian Beasts. Even stronger than Deities!

heroin_normal:Your name is Temar?

heroin_smile:Temar! Can you step aside, please?

temar:I refuse to do so.

heroin_oing:Huh?

temar:You must defeat me in order to reach Lord Aramute's temple.

heroin_oing:What does that mean?!

temar:You will know once you get to Aramute Temple. I shall accompany you should you come out victorious.

heroin_oing:Can't you come with me without the fight? I've been doing well until now…

temar:If you wish me to follow your will, your magic must be just as potent.

heroin_crisis:*gulp* …I've never faced a Dragon before!!

temar:This is but a test. I shall be lenient with you.

blackBird_normal:Despite what he says, you should fight for your life. You could really die.

heroin_crisis:I know!
