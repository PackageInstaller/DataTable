heroin_smile:Mom! I passed the test!

eliy:Really?

blackBird_normal:With flying colors.

eliy:My…I thought it may have been too much for you…

blackBird_normal:Lady Lucia has grown strong by herself.

blackBird_normal:So I think she was able to defeat herself easily.

eliy:You're all grown up…!

eliy:Soon, I can let you handle my work, too!

heroin_surprised:Wha…?

heroin_sigh:Not yet…besides, I'm not interested in doing godly stuff…

eliy:Don't worry…it won't be in a while.

eliy:And you will one day find yourself wanting to do the work, even if I don't force it upon you.

eliy:You're a good child.

heroin_sigh:Still…I don't like complicated work…

eliy:Ha…your mom may seem really busy right now…

eliy:But actually, no one is as busy as Aramute, who is in charge of Vavelia Village and the capital.

eliy:Aramute has no vacations.

eliy:But we only have to hear the prayers that are brought to us every few times per month!

eliy:We're free to do as we wish otherwise!

heroin_normal:Wow, so I can still travel around like I've been doing?

eliy:I encourage you to travel…

eliy:And see the world for yourself!

heroin_sigh:*sigh* …That's a relief.

heroin_smile:I thought I had to be locked up in a room and work all day!

blackBird_normal:So, can I take a vacation…?

heroin_normal:What?

heroin_normal:You're not allowed any vacations.

heroin_normal:You have to serve me so that I can rest! What were you thinking?

blackBird_normal:(I'll run away, I swear…)

heroin_normal:…Hmm?

blackBird_normal:It's nothing.

heroin_normal:I thought I heard you say you'll run away?

blackBird_normal:You're imagining it.

eliy:Haha, don't worry, Lucia.

eliy:Ark has threatened to run away for centuries, but he never has.

blackBird_normal:…*groan* …
