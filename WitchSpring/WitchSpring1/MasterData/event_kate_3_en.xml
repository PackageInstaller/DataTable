event:1

heroin_normal:……

heroin_normal:It must have been hard, being ignored.

heroin_normal:Kate, you must have hated the village for that.

heroin_sigh:Sorry, but no.

heroin_normal:You already have a good friend.

kate:No…I'll hold on to them…make them friends…

heroin:Kate.

heroin:Alfredo says to wait a little bit more for him.

kate:…Alfie…?

heroin_normal:He's a farmer now, and living well.

heroin_normal:I heard he was ignored and bullied like you.

heroin_normal:But he tried his best to overcome himself.

heroin_smile:And also got beat up pretty badly by me!

kate:Alfredo…

heroin_normal:He's supporting his mother and doing fine.

heroin_normal:He told me he was happy.

heroin_normal:He also wanted you to know that he's happy.

kate:…Alfie…is…

kate:Happy…now…?

heroin_normal:So stop hoarding poor souls.

heroin_normal:He says he'll come to you someday, so wait for him until then.

heroin_smile:And when you meet, Alfredo promised he'll play with you forever.

kate:…A…Alfie…

heroin_normal:No more of this capturing poor souls, okay?

heroin_normal:?You already have a good friend, right?

kate:Alfredo……

event:4

blackBird_normal:I never thought you would be good at persuasion…

heroin_sigh:It was nothing. I simply restored what Kate had lost.

blackBird_normal:Alfredo, you mean?

heroin_normal:Alfredo said he was the only one who cared for Kate…

heroin_sigh:But she thought she had no friends at all.

blackBird_normal:That's why she was capturing the souls. She was lonely even after death…

kate:…Okay…I'll wait…

kate:Tell Alfredo…
