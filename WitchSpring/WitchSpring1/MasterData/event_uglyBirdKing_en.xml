heroin_surprised:…Whoa…that's a big one.

heroin_surprised:Big and…ugly…

blackBird_normal:Be careful. That's probably the boss of the birds.

heroin_normal:Hmm? Is it powerful?

blackBird_normal:Not powerful, but more like annoying…if you attack it, its minions will flock towards you.

heroin_normal:Minions? You mean the uglies?

blackBird_normal:The BIRDS will come for you.

heroin_normal:So the UGLY birds will come for me.

blackBird_normal:Arrgh, stop it!

heroin_normal:What can mere birds do even if they come at me? I'll just burn them to a crisp!
