heroin_surprised:A Palace Warrior…?!

heroin_crisis:No…a Dark Warrior?

blackBird_normal:Hmm?

heroin_normal:Black Joe. What is that thing? Is it a Dark Warrior?

heroin_normal:I can sense dark magic power, but it's different!

blackBird_normal:That one…he seems very stable for a Dark Warrior.

blackBird_normal:Power surges uncontrollably when you absorb a Dark Magic Stone…so how…?

rivia:Let me explain.

heroin_surprised:It talks?!

blackBird_normal:And is quite reasonable…

heroin_surprised:And it's a SHE!! What's happening?

rivia:My name is Livya.

rivia:You're a Witch, it seems.

heroin_sigh:*sigh* …A Witch…

heroin_sigh:(She doesn't seem to know about the outside news because she's stuck here.)

rivia:I'm the only Palace Warrior who successfully absorbed the Dark Magic Stone.

heroin_normal:Successfully…? So why are you imprisoned here?

rivia:After the absorption, I lost consciousness and did not awaken for a long time…

rivia:And so the Pope locked this place up, thinking that I had failed.

rivia:When I awoke, I was here alone…with the bodies of my comrades…

heroin_normal:So this is where the failures are discarded?

blackBird_normal:And the Pope didn't realize that there was a single success case.

rivia:The Pope is blameless.

rivia:Witch. You being here means the way is open.

rivia::I'll kill you and return to the Pope!
