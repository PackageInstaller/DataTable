none-4:This will be my private request.

heroin_normal:I don't care what it is! Just give me my gold!

none-4:Get me the egg of the Zirconia Dragon.

heroin_sigh:You better have that gold ready…a Dragon is really hard to hunt…

none-4:Will 7,000 gold be enough?

heroin_normal:Nope, I'm putting my life on the line! Give me ten thousand!

none-4:Haha, yes. A Dragon Egg is worth whatever you wish…I can always sell it for more.

heroin_sigh:*sigh* …How much will you sell it for, after paying ten thousand to me…?

heroin_sigh:I'm a Witch, so I can't sell it at the village myself…

none-4:Ha. Still, it is because you are a Witch that you have a chance at catching this Dragon.

none-4:The Warriors cannot even scratch the hide of the Zirconia Dragon with their blades.

heroin_normal:Fine. Just have the ten thousand gold ready!
