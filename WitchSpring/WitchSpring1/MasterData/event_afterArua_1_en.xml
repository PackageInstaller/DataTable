arua:Oh…what brings you here, Lucia?

heroin_smile:Hello, Lord Arua!

arua:You were a happy child, but you seem more so, now.

heroin_smile:Haha.

heroin_smile:This is where my adventure began, so…

heroin_smile:It seems more memorable.

arua:You were a very small child then.

heroin_smile:Hehe!

heroin_normal:So, what are you doing now, Lord Arua?

arua:I manage the weather.

arua:For example, I command the rain…

arua:Or calm a storm.

heroin_surprised:Wow…

heroin_surprised:Then you must be really busy!

arua:Indeed, of the spheres we oversee, mine has the most variations.

arua:Weather changes constantly, after all…

arua:However, Aramute the First Temple Lord, has the busiest job.

arua:Aramute is also the chief among the gods, you see.

arua:He oversees most of the miracles that occur in temples.

heroin_surprised:I see… 

heroin_sigh:The gods sure are busy.

arua:Someday, you will take over managing Elysion's spring.

heroin_sigh:*sigh* …I like my freedom…

heroin_sigh:When do you think that will be?

arua:Hmm…

arua:Perhaps in five centuries? Or Elysion can do it for eternity.

heroin_surprised:Oh…!!

arua:When Elysion tires of overseeing her spring, she will hand it over to you.

arua:It could happen tomorrow.

heroin_sigh:Oh…
