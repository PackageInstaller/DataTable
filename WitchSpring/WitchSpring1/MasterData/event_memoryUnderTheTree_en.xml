heroin_surprised:Huh…what? How long have I been asleep?

blackBird_normal:About five hours. You must have had a wonderful dream - you slept like a baby.

blackBird_normal:You sleep nine hours everyday, but you still needed more rest.

heroin_sad:…Yeah. I must have been exhausted by the Warriors.

heroin_normal:Wait…so you kept watch next to me for hours?

blackBird_normal:It's what I do.

blackBird_normal:The temple's just ahead. Let's go!
