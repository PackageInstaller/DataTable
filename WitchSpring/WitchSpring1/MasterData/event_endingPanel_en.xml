Hey you, you want to see the ending again?
Unfortunately, the stupid developer released this game without leaving an ending log.
So re-watching the ending was never even possible! What did you expect?
Just blame the stupid developer! Hehehe!
……
However…
I'm worried that if you can't watch the ending you cleared, you might delete the game.
…Bah, fine. Then I'll have to make the ending re-watchable.
But I still need proof that you cleared the ending!
So there will be a quiz that only those who saw the ending can answer!
By the way, this quiz is only for previous players. If you've downloaded for the first time, there will be no quiz.
