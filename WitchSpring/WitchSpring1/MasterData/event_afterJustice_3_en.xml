heroin:Did you miss me?

justice:I'm…I'm working.

heroin:I know you're free right now. You have no missions!

heroin:You're so by-the-book!

justice:Haha, sorry. Old habit.

heroin:Are you going to be a Warrior forever?

heroin:You're the husband of Pieberry, the Temple-Lord-to-be!

justice:But right now, the government system is still being established, so…

justice:I think I'll need to serve in public safety until it's all organized.

heroin:Oww…

heroin:Fine. I'll be understanding!

justice:Thank you!

heroin:But you'll have to go on a trip with me everyday after you quit, okay?

justice:Ha, okay.

justice:I'll take you to places other than Vavelia.

justice:There are so many amazing things you just have to see.

heroin_surprised:Wow…really?

heroin_surprised:I thought you were always working - I guess you went sightseeing, too?

justice:I was dispatched to many regions…so I didn't get to enjoy them, but I did visit many great places.

heroin_smile:Okay! I'm thrilled!
