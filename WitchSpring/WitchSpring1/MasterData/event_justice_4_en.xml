blackBird_normal:깨어나셨군요.

blackBird_normal:Thankfully, Justice held you tightly, so you weren't injured that much.

heroin_surprised:Oh…

blackBird_normal:He said he'll let it go this time for saving the child, but he won't be merciful next time.

heroin_angry:Hmmph…still didn't apologize, did he?

heroin_normal:……

heroin_normal:Wait…he was injured in my stead?

heroin_shy:I'm kinda grateful for that…

blackBird_normal:Don’t' tell me…that you like him?

heroin_shy:When he held me, it was pretty awesome…

blackBird_normal:Wake up! He's a Warrior! A Warrior bent on killing you!

heroin_shy:But he's the first Warrior to save me, too…

blackBird_normal:Is this what puberty is?! Just kill me, don't you? I do NOT approve of this!

heroin_normal:What's with the reaction? It's not like I said I'll marry him!

blackBird_normal:Oh…so it was a joke, right?

heroin_shy:…Yeeeeaaah…a…joke…?
