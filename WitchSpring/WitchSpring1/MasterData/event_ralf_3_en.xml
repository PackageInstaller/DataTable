none-4:Ha, thanks to you, I can now supply good for the Pope's Castle.

heroin_normal:What do you mean?

none-4:Remember the Lava Stone you fetched for me? I told you there was a demand for the rough stone.

heroin_normal:Yeah, I remember. The rough stones were dangerous and were outlawed…

none-4:It turns out the Papacy ordered the rough stone…

none-4:They outlawed it for normal people, but in fact the Pope had been collecting them.

heroin_surprised:Oh…

none-4:On top of that, I must now supply them with…the Dark Magic Stone, which is absolutely forbidden!

heroin_normal:The Dark Magic Stone? Normal Humans shouldn't be using those!

none-4:So you know. The power of the Dark Magic Stone is enticing, but it is a dangerous thing that will dominate the user…

none-4:That is what the Papacy ordered from me directly.

heroin_normal:Aha, so the Pope is planning something fishy in the shadows.

heroin_sigh:Which doesn't surprise me. Humans always want to become more powerful, so that they can fight more…

heroin_sigh:I would never train or study magic - it's so boring - if my life wasn't in danger…

none-4:I would forfeit my life if this got out…

none-4:But since you are my best supplier and a Witch, I can share everything with you.

heroin_normal:Anyway, you want me to get a Dark Magic Stone, right?

none-4:Indeed. But I do not know where the Dark Magic Stone can be found.

none-4:All I know is that there are Warriors who have been dominated by the Dark Magic Stones while trying to use their power…they are called the Dark Warriors.

heroin_normal:Got it. I'll start looking, then!
